- A div contains a Number
- a nother div as a counter show the same number and keep decreasing the number untill hits
-- a four, it will open google website in another window
-- a seven it will open google website in a popup window
-- a zero, the count down will stop
- I used setInterval for counting down
- And used clearInterval to stop counting down
